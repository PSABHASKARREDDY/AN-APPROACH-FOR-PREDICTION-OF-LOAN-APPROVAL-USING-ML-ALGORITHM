# AN-APPROACH-FOR-PREDICTION-OF-LOAN-APPROVAL-USING-ML-ALGORITHM

The project will be able to predict the loan status with a good accuracy. This will be beneficial for the people because they will have an early idea and prediction of loan status. Our model will work with good accuracy in order to predict the Loan status from given dateset .We suggest a machine learning-based logistic regression analysis model for loan approval in this project. The purpose or the importance of using Logistic Regression was that it uses the concept of predictive analysis which was suitable enough for describing the data.The advantages of Proposed System is (1).Great accuracy (2).Time efficient (3).Simple UI (4).Itâ€™s a web based application (5).It gives perfect result.
